Object-Oriented Programming with TypeScript
This repository contains examples of using TypeScript to implement object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, getters and setters, inheritance, singleton, decorators, abstract classes, protected and private access modifiers, interfaces, and generics.

# Topics Covered
* Classes
* Getters and Setters
* Inheritance
* Singleton
* Decorator
* Abstract
* Protected
* Private
* Interfaces
* Generics

# Classes
Classes are a blueprint for creating objects that contain properties and methods. TypeScript supports the ES6 class syntax and also has some additional features like public, private, and protected access modifiers. In this repository, you will find examples of defining and using classes in TypeScript.

# Getters and Setters
Getters and setters are methods that get and set the values of class properties. TypeScript provides a way to define getters and setters in classes using the get and set keywords. In this repository, you will find examples of defining and using getters and setters in TypeScript.

# Inheritance
Inheritance is a way of creating a new class from an existing class. The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class and can also add its own properties and methods. TypeScript supports inheritance using the extends keyword. In this repository, you will find examples of using inheritance in TypeScript.

# Singleton
Singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. TypeScript supports the implementation of Singleton pattern using classes. In this repository, you will find examples of implementing Singleton pattern in TypeScript.

# Decorator
Decorators are a way to modify the behavior of a class or its members. TypeScript provides a way to define and use decorators in classes using the @ symbol. In this repository, you will find examples of using decorators in TypeScript.

# Abstract
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be inherited by other classes. TypeScript supports abstract classes using the abstract keyword. In this repository, you will find examples of defining and using abstract classes in TypeScript.

# Protected
Protected access modifier restricts the access to a class property or method to its own class and its subclasses. TypeScript supports protected access modifier using the protected keyword. In this repository, you will find examples of using protected access modifier in TypeScript.

# Private
Private access modifier restricts the access to a class property or method to its own class. TypeScript supports private access modifier using the private keyword. In this repository, you will find examples of using private access modifier in TypeScript.

# Interfaces
Interfaces are a way to define a contract for the shape of an object. TypeScript supports interfaces that can be used to describe the shape of objects and also as a way to define contracts for classes. In this repository, you will find examples of defining and using interfaces in TypeScript.

# Generics
Generics are a way to create reusable code that can work with different types. TypeScript supports generics that can be used to create functions, classes, and interfaces that work with different types. In this repository, you will find examples of using generics in TypeScript.

# Conclusion
This repository covers various object-oriented programming concepts in TypeScript. You can use this repository as a reference to learn and implement these concepts in your TypeScript projects. Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding more examples or by improving the existing ones.
